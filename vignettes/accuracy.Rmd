Based on the `demonstration` vignette, we observed in a summarized way that the Expectation-Maximization algorithm tends to lose accuracy when the ballot boxes are homogeneous with respect to the demographic groups.

However, it is worth exploring — in a more formal and mathematical sense — when this loss of precision begins. To investigate this, we adopt an empirical approach by computing the Mean Absolute Error across different values of lambda.

It is important to note that the alpha parameter, as described in the `simulate_election()` documentation, controls the level of shuffling between groups and serves as a proxy for group heterogeneity.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
library(ggplot2)
library(fastei) # assuming this includes simulate_election and run_em
library(dplyr)
library(showtext)
font_add_google("Lato", "lato")
showtext_auto()

lambda_values <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)
methods <- c("exact", "mult", "mvn_cdf", "mvn_pdf", "mcmc")

# Prepare an empty list to hold all results
all_results <- list()

for (method in methods) {
    mae_values <- numeric(length(lambda_values))

    for (i in seq_along(lambda_values)) {
        lambda <- lambda_values[i]

        real <- simulate_election(num_ballots = 50, num_candidates = 2, num_groups = 3, seed = 42, lambda = lambda)

        estimate <- run_em(X = real$X, W = real$W, method = method)
        mae <- mean(abs(real$real_prob - estimate$prob))
        mae_values[i] <- mae
    }

    # Store results in a data frame
    df_method <- data.frame(
        lambda = lambda_values,
        mae = mae_values,
        method = method
    )

    all_results[[method]] <- df_method
}

# Combine all method-specific data frames into one
df_all <- do.call(rbind, all_results)

# Rename methods using a lookup table
label_lookup <- c(
    "exact" = "Exact",
    "mult" = "Multinomial",
    "mvn_cdf" = "MVN-CDF",
    "mvn_pdf" = "MVN-PDF",
    "mcmc" = "MCMC"
)

df_all <- df_all %>%
    mutate(method_label = factor(label_lookup[method], levels = unname(label_lookup)))

# Plot
ggplot(df_all, aes(x = lambda, y = mae, color = method_label)) +
    geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, alpha = 0.4) +
    geom_point(aes(shape = method_label), size = 2.5) +
    labs(
        title = "Mean Absolute Error vs Lambda for Different Methods",
        subtitle = "Among 50 ballot boxes, 2 candidates and 3 groups",
        x = "Lambda",
        y = "Mean Absolute Error",
        color = "Method",
        shape = "Method"
    ) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 12, base_family = "lato")
```

Therefore, by treating the lambda parameter as a measure of heterogeneity, we observe that the method yields an average MAE below $0.05$ when heterogeneity remains under $75\%$.
