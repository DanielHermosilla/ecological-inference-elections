# Ecological Inference in Elections

This repository provides scripts for the ecological inference algorithm described in the paper **"A Fast Ecological Inference Algorithm for the RÃ—C Case."**

## Scripts Overview

- **`Em_algorithms.py`**  
  Implements the EM algorithm to solve the ecological inference problem (EC). Each proposed method has its own file:
  - `EM_full.py`
  - `EM_mult.py`
  - `EM_pdf.py`
  - `EM_cdf.py`
  - `EM_simulate.py`

- **`2021_11_Presidencial_Preproc.py`**  
  Reproduces the main results from the Chilean presidential election (first round) in November 2021.

- **Other Scripts**  
  Perform additional analyses and generate figures and tables for the paper.

## Usage
Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts. Refer to the paper for methodological details and interpretation of results.
