\title{Extracts voting and demographic data matrices for a given electoral district in Chile.}
\usage{
get_XW_chile(elect_district, merge_blank_null = TRUE, remove_mismatch = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{elect_district}{A string indicating the name of the electoral district to extract (e.g., \code{"NIEBLA"}).}

\item{merge_blank_null}{Logical indicating whether blank and null votes should be merged into a single column. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{remove_mismatch}{Logical indicating whether to remove ballot boxes with mismatched vote totals (where \code{MISMATCH == TRUE}). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link{eim}} object with the following attributes:
\itemize{
\item \strong{X}: A matrix \verb{(b x c)} with the number of votes per candidate (including a column for blank + null votes if \code{merge_blank_null = TRUE}).
\item \strong{W}: A matrix \verb{(b x g)} with the number of voters per group (e.g., age ranges) for each ballot box.
}

This object can be passed to functions like \code{\link{run_em}} or \code{\link{get_agg_proxy}} for estimation and group aggregation.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the voting results and demographic covariates for a given electoral district from the 2021 Chilean election dataset included in this package. The function returns an \code{\link{eim}} object that can be directly used in \code{\link{run_em}} or other estimation functions.
}
\details{
The function builds the \code{X} matrix using the number of votes per candidate, and the \code{W} matrix using the number of voters in each demographic group (e.g., age ranges). Optionally, blank and null votes can be merged into a single additional column (considered as another candidate).

Additionally, ballot boxes where the number of votes does not match the number of registered voters (i.e., those where \code{MISMATCH == TRUE}) can be excluded from the dataset by setting \code{remove_mismatch = TRUE}.

\examples{
# Load data and create an eim object for the electoral district of "NIEBLA"
eim_obj <- get_XW_Chile("NIEBLA", remove_mismatch = FALSE)

# Use it to run the EM algorithm
result <- run_em(eim_obj)

# Use it with group aggregation
agg_result <- get_agg_proxy(
    object = eim_obj,
    sd_threshold = 0.03,
    allow_mismatch = TRUE,
    seed = 123
